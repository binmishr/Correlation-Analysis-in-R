# Correlation-Analysis-in-R

In correlation analysis, we estimate a sample correlation coefficient based on experimental data, in most cases the Pearson Product Moment correlation coefficient is used to find the relationships.

The sample correlation coefficient denoted r.

The correlation coefficient ranges between -1 and +1 and quantifies the direction and strength of the linear association between the two variables.

The correlation between two variables can be positive (i.e., higher levels of one variable are associated with higher levels of the other) or negative (i.e., higher levels of one variable are associated with lower levels of the other).

The sign of the correlation coefficient indicates the direction of the association.

The magnitude of the correlation coefficient indicates the strength of the association.
